# Ice-Cream

I followed along with the video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5ZtTO1ArWg for this project. I've spent a lot of the last few weeks watching videos and writing small code that didn't amount to anything that would be considered a project so I wanted to do a code-along to practice Callbacks, Async/Await and arrow functions because I'm more of a hands-on learner.
